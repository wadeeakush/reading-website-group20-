            We are students of SCE college of engineering
            Our website is working with people with Dyslexics, we are helping them make their lives comfortable as much as we can.
            In our website they can read stories (different stories depends on the level of the kid) to increase their confidence .to make it special and unique our website has the ability to read the story aloud so they hear the pronounce of each word correctly, which gives them a huge boost of confidence.
            Our web site also deals with sharing and reporting to every parent the result of their children so they can keep track on the progressive of their children step by step.
